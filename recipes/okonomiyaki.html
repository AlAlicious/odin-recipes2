    <h3>Okonomiyaki is a savory Japanese pancake using a wheat-based batter with eggs.</h3>
    <h3>The mix-ins and toppings vary depending on the region of Japan.</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><h4>1/2 small head cabbage, finely shredded</h4></li>
        <li><h4>3 scallions</h4></li>
        <li><h4>2 ounces (50g) beni-shoga</h4></li>
        <li><h4>1/2 ounce (15g) katsuobushi</h4></li>
        <li><h4>1/4 pound (120g) yamaimo</h4></li>
        <li><h4>2 large eggs</h4></li>
        <li><h4>1/2 cup (120ml) cold water or dashi</h4></li>
        <li><h4>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</h4></li>
        <li><h4>8 to 10 thin slices uncured pork belly</h4></li>
        <li><h4>2 tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil</h4></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Combine cabbage, scallion whites and half of greens, half of beni-shoga, 3/4 of katsuobushi, yamaimo, eggs, and water (or dashi) in a large bowl.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle with flour. Stir with a fork and beat heavily until a thick batter with plenty of bubbles forms. Set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>If using pork belly, cover the bottom of a 10-inch nonstick skillet with pork belly and set over medium heat. Add okonomiyaki mixture and spread into an even layer with a fork.</p>
        <p>If not using pork belly, heat vegetable oil in skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add okonomiyaki mixture and spread into an even layer with a fork.</p></li>
        <li><p>Cover and cook, shaking pan occasionally, until bottom layer is crisp and well browned, about 10 minutes, lowering heat as necessary if cabbage threatens to burn.</p></li>
        <li><p>To flip, drain off any excess fat, then, working over a sink and holding the lid tightly against pan with a pot holder,</p>
        <p>flip entire pan and lid over so that okonomiyaki transfers to pan lid. Remove pan, then carefully slide okonomiyaki off lid and back into pan, browned side up.</p></li>
        <li><p>Return to heat, cover, and continue to cook, shaking gently, until both sides are browned and okonomiyaki is not runny but still custardy and tender in the center,</p> 
        <p>about 8 minutes longer. Transfer to a serving platter, pork side up.</p></li>
        <li><p>Drizzle with okonomiyaki sauce and mayonnaise; sprinkle with ao-nori, remaining beni-shoga,</p> 
        <p>remaining katsuobushi, and remaining scallion greens; and serve immediately off of a communal plate.</p></li>
